# 🏨 Hospitality Intelligence Dashboard – Power BI Project

Welcome to the **Hospitality Intelligence Dashboard**, a real-world business intelligence solution designed for **AtliQ Grands**, a luxury hotel chain facing market and revenue challenges. This project was built as part of a strategic initiative to integrate data-driven decision-making into hotel operations and regain lost market share.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.
